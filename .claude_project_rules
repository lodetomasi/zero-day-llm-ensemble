# Claude Project Rules - Zero-Day LLM Ensemble

## MANDATORY: Read PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md before ANY development

## Core Rules:
1. ALWAYS maintain 5-agent architecture
2. ALWAYS focus on zero-day detection (not "intelligence")  
3. NEVER require human evaluation
4. NEVER hardcode CVE-specific logic
5. ALWAYS provide binary detection output (with confidence)

## Before suggesting ANY change:
1. Check if it maintains all 5 agents
2. Check if it keeps zero-day detection focus
3. Check if it's automatically evaluable
4. If any answer is NO â†’ Don't suggest it

## Development Priorities:
1. Accuracy/F1 score is PRIMARY metric
2. Features must be objective and measurable
3. System must work on ANY CVE
4. Results must be reproducible

## Language: Respond in language used by user (Italian/English)
