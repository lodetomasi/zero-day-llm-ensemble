        "raw_response": "Based on the provided evidence, I will analyze the timeline aspects of this vulnerability.\n\n**Prediction:** 0.8\n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Timeline Analysis:**\nThe fact that the vulnerability was added to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list within 7 days of disclosure suggests a high likelihood of exploitation in the wild. This rapid addition to the KEV list, combined with the detection of exploitation before a patch was available, indicates that the vulnerability was likely being exploited before it was publicly disclosed. This is a strong indicator of a zero-day exploit.\n\nThe lack of a description and specific vendor/product information does not detract from the timeline analysis, as the focus is on the timing of events rather than the details of the vulnerability itself.\n\nThe framework suggests that being added to the KEV list the same week as disclosure is indicative of a likely zero-day exploit. The exploitation detected before a patch was available further supports this conclusion, as it implies that attackers were aware of and exploiting the vulnerability before the vendor could release a fix.\n\nWhile the absence of explicit information about the patch timing (e.g., whether it was emergency or out-of-band) and the appearance of proof-of-concept (PoC) code does not provide additional confirmatory evidence, the given indicators are strong enough to suggest a high probability of this being a zero-day exploit.\n\nThe mention of \"zero-day\" in early reporting, if it occurred, would further support this analysis, but such information is not provided. Nonetheless, based on the evidence of rapid KEV addition and pre-patch exploitation, the likelihood of this vulnerability being a zero-day exploit is considered high."
