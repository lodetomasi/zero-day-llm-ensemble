This rapid addition to the KEV list, combined with the detection of exploitation before a patch was available, implies that attackers were already aware of and exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nThe lack of a description and specific details about the vendor, product, and year does not significantly impact the analysis, as the focus is on the timing of events relative to disclosure and exploitation. The key factors here are the swift addition to the KEV list and the evidence of exploitation before a patch was released.\n\nThe framework suggests that being added to the KEV list in the same week as disclosure (KEV timing) is indicative of a likely zero-day exploit. Additionally, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available implies there was exploitation pressure, which is consistent with the characteristics of a zero-day vulnerability.\n\nWhile the absence of specific information about the patch timing (e.g., whether it was emergency or out-of-band) and the news coverage (e.g., mentions of \"zero-day\" in early reporting) introduces some uncertainty, the available evidence strongly suggests that this vulnerability was exploited before a patch was available, which is a hallmark of zero-day exploits.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided evidence and the timeline analysis framework, it is reasonable to conclude that CVE-2023-20198 was likely a zero-day vulnerability, with a prediction of 0.8 and a confidence level of 0.7."
