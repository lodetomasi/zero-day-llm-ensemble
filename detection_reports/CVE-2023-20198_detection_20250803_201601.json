This is a strong indicator of a potential zero-day exploit, as it implies that exploitation was detected in the wild before or shortly after public disclosure.\n2. **Patch timing**: Although the patch timing is not explicitly mentioned, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available implies that the vendor likely released an emergency or out-of-band patch, which is consistent with exploitation pressure.\n3. **PoC timing**: Unfortunately, there is no information about the timing of the first Proof of Concept (PoC) appearance. However, the rapid addition to the KEV list and the detection of exploitation before a patch suggest that attackers may have had prior knowledge of the vulnerability.\n4. **News coverage**: The lack of information about news coverage makes it difficult to assess the presence of \"zero-day\" mentions in early reporting.\n\nConsidering these factors, the rapid addition to the KEV list and the detection of exploitation before a patch suggest that CVE-2023-20198 was likely a zero-day exploit. However, the absence of information about the PoC timing and news coverage introduces some uncertainty, which is reflected in the confidence level.\n\nThe prediction of 0.8 indicates a strong likelihood of a zero-day exploit, while the confidence level of 0.7 acknowledges the limitations of the available data. If additional information about the PoC timing and news coverage were available, the confidence level could be adjusted accordingly."
