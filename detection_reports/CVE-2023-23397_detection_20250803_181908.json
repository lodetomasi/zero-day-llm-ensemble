This aligns with the framework's indication of a likely zero-day exploit.\n2. **Patch timing**: Although the patch timing is not explicitly mentioned, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available implies that the vendor might have released an emergency or out-of-band patch, which is consistent with exploitation pressure.\n3. **PoC timing**: Unfortunately, there is no information about the Proof of Concept (PoC) timing. However, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available could imply that attackers might have had prior knowledge of the vulnerability.\n4. **News coverage**: The absence of specific news coverage details makes it difficult to assess the \"zero-day\" mentions in early reporting. However, the overall context suggests a potentially zero-day scenario.\n\nConsidering these factors, the rapid addition to the KEV list and exploitation detection before a patch was available are strong indicators of a zero-day exploit. Consideration of the possibility of prior knowledge by attackers, as suggested by the exploitation before patch availability, further supports this assessment.\n\nWhile the confidence level is not extremely high (0.7) due to the lack of explicit information on patch timing and news coverage, the available evidence points toward a likely zero-day exploit, leading to a prediction of 0.8."
