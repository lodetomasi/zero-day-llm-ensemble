        "raw_response": "Based on the provided evidence, I'll analyze the timeline aspects of the vulnerability.\n\n**Prediction:** 0.8\n**Confidence:** 0.9\n**Timeline Analysis:**\n\nThe fact that the vulnerability was added to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list within 7 days of disclosure suggests a high likelihood of zero-day exploitation. This rapid addition to the KEV list, as per the framework, indicates that the vulnerability was likely being exploited in the wild before or very close to the time of disclosure (KEV timing).\n\nThe evidence of exploitation detected before a patch was available further supports the notion of a zero-day scenario. This implies that attackers had knowledge of the vulnerability and were actively exploiting it before the vendor could release a patch (Patch timing).\n\nAlthough there is no explicit information about the emergence of a Proof of Concept (PoC), the combination of rapid KEV addition and pre-patch exploitation suggests that there might have been prior knowledge of the vulnerability among attackers, which could have facilitated the development of a PoC soon after disclosure.\n\nThe lack of detailed news coverage information makes it difficult to assess the \"zero-day\" mentions in early reporting. However, the presence of a vulnerability in the KEV list, especially when added shortly after disclosure, often correlates with zero-day exploitation scenarios.\n\nConsidering these factors, the timeline analysis strongly suggests that CVE-2023-20198 was likely a zero-day vulnerability. The prediction and confidence levels reflect the strength of the evidence pointing towards a zero-day scenario, with the main uncertainty stemming from the absence of specific details about PoC timing and news coverage."
