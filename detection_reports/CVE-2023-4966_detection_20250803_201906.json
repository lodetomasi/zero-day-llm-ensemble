This suggests that the vulnerability was likely being exploited in the wild before its public disclosure, which is a characteristic of zero-day exploits.\n2. **Patch timing**: Although the exact patch timing is not provided, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available implies that the vendor might have released an emergency or out-of-band patch, indicating exploitation pressure.\n3. **PoC timing**: Unfortunately, there is no information about the timing of the first Proof of Concept (PoC) appearance. However, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available suggests that attackers might have had prior knowledge of the vulnerability.\n4. **News coverage**: The lack of detailed news coverage information makes it difficult to assess the \"zero-day\" mentions in early reporting. However, the fact that it's listed in the CISA KEV catalog implies that the vulnerability was considered significant and potentially zero-day.\n\nConsidering these factors, the timeline analysis suggests that CVE-2023-4966 was likely a zero-day exploit, given the rapid addition to the CISA KEV list and the detection of exploitation before a patch was available. However, the confidence level is moderate due to the limited information available about the patch timing, PoC appearance, and news coverage.\n\nTo increase confidence in this prediction, additional information about the patch timing, PoC appearance, and news coverage would be necessary. Nevertheless, based on the available evidence, it is likely that CVE-2023-4966 was a zero-day exploit."
