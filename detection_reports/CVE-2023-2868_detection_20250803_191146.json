The exploitation detected before a patch was available further supports this notion, implying that attackers had knowledge of the vulnerability before the vendor or the public (exploitation detected before patch).\n\nThe association with 1 APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group indicates that sophisticated actors were involved, which is consistent with zero-day exploitation. Although there is no explicit information on the PoC (Proof of Concept) timing or news coverage mentioning \"zero-day\" in early reporting, the available evidence points towards a likely zero-day scenario.\n\nHowever, without more specific details on the disclosure and patch timing, I couldn't assign a higher confidence level. The prediction of 0.8 reflects the strong likelihood of a zero-day vulnerability, but the confidence of 0.7 acknowledges the potential for some uncertainty due to the limited information available."
