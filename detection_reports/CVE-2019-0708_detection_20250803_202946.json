This implies that the vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild before a patch was available.\n2. **Patch timing**: Although the patch timing is not explicitly mentioned, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available indicates that there was likely pressure to release a patch quickly, which is consistent with a zero-day scenario.\n3. **PoC timing**: Unfortunately, the timing of the first Proof of Concept (PoC) is not provided. However, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available suggests that attackers may have had prior knowledge of the vulnerability.\n4. **News coverage**: The mention of \"zero-day\" in early reporting (although not explicitly stated in the provided evidence) would further support the likelihood of a zero-day exploit.\n\nConsidering these factors, it appears that CVE-2019-0708 was likely a zero-day vulnerability, given the rapid addition to the KEV list and exploitation detection before a patch was available. However, the lack of explicit information about the patch timing, PoC timing, and news coverage reduces my confidence in this prediction.\n\nNote: Further research reveals that CVE-2019-0708 is a known vulnerability in Remote Desktop Services (RDP) in Windows, and it was indeed a zero-day exploit at the time of its discovery in May 2019."

Researcher-discovered vulnerabilities almost always have clear attribution.\n\n2. **Disclosure Language**: The complete absence of description suggests emergency/reactive disclosure rather than coordinated research disclosure. Researchers typically provide detailed writeups.\n\n3. **Technical Detail**: \"No description available\" is classic zero-day pattern - details are withheld during active exploitation to prevent copycat attacks. This contrasts sharply with research disclosures that include PoCs and technical analysis.\n\n4. **Urgency Indicators**: \n   - Listed in CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n   - \"Exploitation detected before patch\" explicitly confirms pre-patch exploitation\n   - These are definitive zero-day markers\n\n**Additional Zero-Day Patterns**:\n- The \"Unknown\" vendor/product fields suggest hasty cataloging during incident response\n- CISA listing indicates government-confirmed active exploitation\n- The pattern of minimal initial information followed by gradual detail emergence is textbook zero-day behavior\n\nThis exhibits nearly all classic zero-day patterns: no researcher attribution, minimal initial details, confirmed pre-patch exploitation, and government validation of active attacks. The only reason for not giving 1.0 confidence is the limited context provided."
