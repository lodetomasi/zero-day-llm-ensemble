This rapid addition to the KEV list (KEV timing) implies that the vulnerability was likely being exploited before or very shortly after its public disclosure, aligning with the criteria for a zero-day.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence of exploitation detected before a patch was available indicates exploitation pressure, which is consistent with the scenario of a zero-day attack where attackers have knowledge of the vulnerability before a patch is released. This exploitation before patch availability (patch timing) supports the notion of a zero-day, as it suggests that the vulnerability was being exploited under the assumption that no patch was available to remediate it.\n\nWhile there is no direct information provided about the timing of the Proof of Concept (PoC) or the specifics of news coverage, the combination of rapid KEV addition and exploitation before patching are strong indicators of a zero-day scenario. The lack of detailed information about the PoC and news coverage introduces some uncertainty, which is reflected in the confidence level.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence of rapid KEV addition and exploitation before patching, it is reasonable to predict that CVE-2023-3519 was likely a zero-day vulnerability. However, without additional details on PoC timing and news coverage, the confidence in this prediction, while high, is not absolute."
