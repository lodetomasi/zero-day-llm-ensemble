This rapid addition to the KEV list, combined with the detection of exploitation before a patch was available, indicates that attackers may have had prior knowledge of the vulnerability.\n\nThe absence of a description and specific vendor/product information limits the analysis, but the available evidence points towards a potentially zero-day scenario. The \"same week as disclosure\" KEV addition timing (framework point 1) and exploitation detection before patch availability (framework point 2) are strong indicators of a zero-day or near-zero-day exploit.\n\nWhile there is no explicit information on the patch timing (emergency/out-of-band) or PoC appearance, the fact that exploitation was detected before a patch was available implies a sense of urgency, which is consistent with a zero-day scenario.\n\nThe lack of specific news coverage details, such as \"zero-day\" mentions in early reporting, prevents further confirmation. However, the available evidence and the KEV addition timing suggest a high likelihood of a zero-day or near-zero-day exploit.\n\nOverall, based on the provided evidence and framework, I predict that CVE-2022-26134 is likely a zero-day vulnerability, with a prediction score of 0.8 and a confidence level of 0.7."
