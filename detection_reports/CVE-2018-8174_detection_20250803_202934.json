        "raw_response": "Based on the provided evidence and timeline analysis framework, I will analyze the vulnerability.\n\nGiven that the vulnerability is listed in CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) and exploitation was detected before a patch was available, it suggests that the vulnerability was likely being exploited in the wild before a fix was released. The fact that it was added to the KEV list the same week as disclosure implies a high likelihood of it being a zero-day exploit, as indicated by the framework's first point.\n\nHowever, without specific dates for the CVE publication, patch release, and the appearance of the first Proof of Concept (PoC), it's challenging to apply the full framework accurately. Nonetheless, the detection of exploitation before the patch and the KEV listing timing are strong indicators.\n\nConsidering the factors that distinguish zero-days from responsible disclosures:\n- The presence of exploitation before a patch was available strongly suggests a zero-day scenario.\n- The urgency implied by the addition to the KEV list the same week as disclosure further supports this.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Prediction**: 0.8 (The vulnerability was likely a zero-day exploit, given the exploitation detected before patch and the KEV addition timing.)\n- **Confidence**: 0.7 (While the indicators are strong, the lack of specific dates for key events and the absence of detailed descriptions limit the confidence level.)\n- **Timeline Analysis**: The temporal relationship between the KEV addition, exploitation detection, and the implied urgency of the vendor's response suggest a scenario where the vulnerability was being exploited before public disclosure, fitting the profile of a zero-day exploit. The rapid addition to the KEV list underscores the severity and the likelihood of active exploitation, which is consistent with zero-day vulnerabilities. However, without more detailed timeline information, the analysis relies on the implications of the available evidence."
