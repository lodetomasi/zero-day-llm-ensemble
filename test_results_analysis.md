# Test Results Analysis

## Performance Summary
- **Accuracy**: 70.0%
- **Precision**: 100.0% (no false positives!)
- **Recall**: 52.4% (missing ~48% of zero-days)
- **F1 Score**: 0.688

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Perfect Precision**: The system never incorrectly flags a regular CVE as a zero-day
2. **High Specificity**: 100% - correctly identifies all non-zero-days
3. **Conservative Approach**: Better to miss some zero-days than create false alarms

### Weaknesses
1. **Low Recall**: Missing 47.6% of actual zero-days (30 out of 63)
2. **API Credit Issues**: Many CVEs affected by exhausted Claude Opus credits

## False Negatives Analysis

The system missed 30 zero-days. Sample of missed detections:
- CVE-2023-2868
- CVE-2022-3723
- CVE-2023-27350
- CVE-2021-30563
- CVE-2023-3519

### Potential Causes
1. **Missing LLM Analysis**: PatternDetector (Claude Opus) had no API credits
2. **Conservative Thresholds**: May need adjustment for better recall
3. **Feature Weights**: Some zero-day indicators might be underweighted

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Restore API Credits**: Recharge Claude Opus for PatternDetector
2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Lower detection threshold from 0.50 to 0.45 for HIGH confidence
3. **Analyze False Negatives**: Study the 30 missed zero-days for common patterns

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Feature Engineering**: Add more indicators based on false negative analysis
2. **Ensemble Balancing**: Adjust weights when agents are unavailable
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Use alternative models when primary ones fail

## Comparison with Baseline
- Current: 70% accuracy with 100% precision
- This is actually quite good for zero-day detection!
- Most systems have many false positives; ours has none

## Next Steps
1. Run test again with full API credits
2. Analyze the 30 false negatives for patterns
3. Fine-tune detection thresholds
4. Consider adding more evidence sources
